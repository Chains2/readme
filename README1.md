===================

For the cross road
------------------
I use 'plot' to make the cross road as well as 'k' and '--' to meet the demands.
* In order to bold the edge of the cross road, I set the linewidth of the lines. But I don't find the way to bold these lines with one line of code, so I use 8 lines to realize it. 


For the traffic light
---------------------
I use 'scatter' to make the traffic light and 'pause' to make the color of the traffic light change with time.<br>
In order to make the loop, I use 'while' to realize it.
* The loop should be ended if two cars collide, but I have not made the cars yet. So the loop now will end after ten times, this part will be reprogramed later.
