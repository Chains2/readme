Homework2
=========
ex.2
----
In this exercise I use 'primes' to get the prime and 'mod' to meet the condition that p=4n+1. <br>
I also use 'sqrt' to divid p into the sum of two squares.

ex.4
----
* ex4I are the iterative one and ex4II are the recursive one. <br>
* I use 'function' in both of them. When you input the things,you'd better use ';' instead of 'Enter' between lines. <br>
* It seems that when I input 384/1000 in Matlab, the answer will be 0.3840. So what is the precision of 0.3840? Three or four?
